1) Download and install the PostgreSQL database,
   which can be found here: https://www.postgresql.org/download/


2) Open psql and create the PetClinic database:
 
	create database petclinic;
  	create user petclinic_user with encrypted password 'your_password';
  	grant all privileges on database petclinic to petclinic_user;

3) Create the PetClinic tables by executing the "db/postgresql/schema.sql".
Then execute "db/postgresql/data.sql" script.
Or uncomment the following line
# spring.datasource.initialization-mode=always
 in application-postgresql.properties file when you run the app for the first time.
